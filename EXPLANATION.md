# ChefDao Agent Explanation

## Agent Reasoning Process

### ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) Framework

ChefDao implements the ReAct framework, which interleaves **reasoning** (thinking) and **acting** (tool usage) to solve complex culinary tasks. This approach mirrors how a human chef would approach helping someone cook.

#### Reasoning Chain Example

When a user asks "I want to make kung pao chicken", the system goes through this thought process:

```
Thought: The user wants to cook kung pao chicken. This is a classic Sichuan dish. 
         Since they're a beginner (from memory), I should provide a complete cooking plan.
Action: call recipe_agent with {"dish": "kung pao chicken", "skill": "beginner"}

Thought: Now that I have the recipe, I need to help them understand the ingredients 
         and where to find them, especially since some Chinese ingredients might be unfamiliar.
Action: call ingredient_agent with recipe context

Thought: With the recipe and ingredients sorted, they'll need detailed step-by-step 
         instructions that account for their beginner skill level.
Action: call instruction_agent with recipe and ingredient context

Thought: It would be valuable to understand the cultural significance of this dish
         to appreciate what they're cooking.
Action: call culture_agent with {"dish": "kung pao chicken"}
```

#### Why ReAct Works for Cooking

1. **Sequential Dependencies**: Cooking instructions depend on having the recipe, which depends on knowing the dish
2. **Context Accumulation**: Each agent builds on previous knowledge (recipe ‚Üí ingredients ‚Üí instructions)
3. **Flexible Planning**: Different user requests require different agent combinations
4. **Human-like Problem Solving**: Mirrors how a chef thinks through helping someone cook

### Planning Style

#### Dynamic Task Generation

The planner doesn't use fixed workflows. Instead, it analyzes each user request and generates appropriate task sequences:

**Simple Recipe Request**:
```
"steamed fish" ‚Üí [recipe_agent, instruction_agent]
```

**Complete Cooking Help**:
```
"I want to learn about mapo tofu" ‚Üí [recipe_agent, ingredient_agent, instruction_agent, culture_agent, nutrition_agent]
```

**Ingredient-Focused Query**:
```
"What can I make with tofu and soy sauce?" ‚Üí [recipe_agent, ingredient_agent]
```

#### Intelligent Agent Selection

The planner considers:
- **User's explicit needs**: "nutrition info" ‚Üí include nutrition_agent
- **Skill level**: Beginners get more detailed instruction_agent calls
- **Cultural interest**: Questions about traditions ‚Üí include culture_agent
- **Practical needs**: Shopping help ‚Üí prioritize ingredient_agent

## Memory Usage

### User Preference Learning

ChefDao maintains persistent memory of user characteristics:

```json
{
  "skill_level": "beginner",
  "dietary_restrictions": ["vegetarian"],
  "available_ingredients": ["soy_sauce", "rice", "tofu"],
  "cooking_history": ["fried_rice", "steamed_vegetables"],
  "preferences": {
    "spice_level": "mild",
    "preferred_regions": ["Cantonese", "Shanghai"],
    "cooking_time": "under_30_minutes"
  }
}
```

### Memory Application in Planning

The planner uses memory to customize responses:

1. **Skill-Appropriate Recipes**: Beginners get simpler dishes and more detailed instructions
2. **Dietary Filtering**: Automatically considers restrictions when suggesting recipes
3. **Ingredient Optimization**: Prioritizes recipes using available ingredients
4. **Cultural Preferences**: Favors regions the user has shown interest in

### Context Sharing Between Agents

During execution, agents share context to maintain coherence:

```python
# Recipe agent generates recipe
recipe_context = "Kung Pao Chicken recipe with ingredients: chicken, peanuts..."

# Ingredient agent receives recipe context
ingredient_prompt = f"Based on this recipe: {recipe_context}, provide shopping guidance..."

# Instruction agent receives both recipe and ingredient context
instruction_prompt = f"Using recipe: {recipe_context} and ingredients: {ingredient_context}..."
```

This ensures each agent builds on previous work rather than starting from scratch.

## Tool Integration

### Google Gemini API Integration

#### Model Selection Strategy
- **gemini-1.5-flash**: Chosen for balance of speed and capability
- **Optimized for reasoning**: Good at step-by-step thinking required by ReAct
- **Cost-effective**: Suitable for real-time cooking assistance

#### Prompt Engineering Approach

Each agent type has specialized prompts:

**Recipe Agent Prompt Structure**:
```
Role: "As an expert Chinese chef and cookbook author..."
Task: "provide an authentic recipe for {dish}"
Context: "suitable for {skill_level} cook with {dietary_restrictions}"
Output Format: "Include ingredient list, equipment, preparation overview..."
```

**Instruction Agent Prompt Structure**:
```
Role: "As an experienced Chinese cooking instructor..."
Context: "Based on this recipe: {previous_recipe_output}..."
Task: "provide detailed step-by-step instructions"
Customization: "tailored for {skill_level} with available {equipment}"
```

#### Error Handling and Resilience

```python
try:
    model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')
    response = model.generate_content(prompt)
    return response.text.strip()
except Exception as e:
    return f"Error calling Gemini API: {str(e)}"
```

- **Graceful degradation**: System continues operating even if individual calls fail
- **User feedback**: Clear error messages help users understand issues
- **Fallback planning**: If ReAct parsing fails, system provides reasonable default tasks

### Context Size Management

To handle Gemini's context limits effectively:

```python
# Limit recipe context to prevent overflow
if recipe_text:
    context_snippet = recipe_text[:500] + "..."
```

This ensures:
- Important information is preserved
- API calls remain efficient
- Context stays focused on key details

## Agent Specialization Strategy
